# live555

This  is a class that wrap live555 library for client. It is robust, solid and ease to use,
it is based on code from VLC (www.videolan.org). You only have to include two files 
live555client.h and live555client.cpp into your code. In header file, have no any including to 
live555's header files, so you integrate easily into your project.

One important thing is: These codes need be built under c++1x :). My aim is for cross-platform build.
